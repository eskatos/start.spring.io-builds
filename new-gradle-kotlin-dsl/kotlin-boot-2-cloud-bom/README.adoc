= Kotlin Spring Boot Application with dependencies with Gradle Kotlin DSL build

* Requires Gradle 5 for the Kotlin DSL and to consume BOMs using `enforcedPlatform(..)`
* Very similar to Java and Groovy applications, just has Kotlin compiler configuration added
* Kotlin compiler configuration is now applied to all `KotlinCompile` tasks
* Prefer the `plugins {}` block over `buildscript { dependencies { classpath(..) } }` & `apply plugin:id`
* Plugin repositories moved to `settings.gradle`
* Dependency versions declared in a type instead of as extra properties
