= Minimal Kotlin Spring Boot SNAPSHOT Application with Gradle 5 Groovy DSL build

* Very similar to Java and Groovy applications, just has Kotlin compiler configuration added
* Kotlin compiler configuration is now applied to all `KotlinCompile` tasks
* Prefer the `plugins {}` block over `buildscript { dependencies { classpath(..) } }` & `apply plugin:id`
* Plugin repositories moved to `settings.gradle`
* Requires `pluginManagement { resolutionStrategy { .. } }` because Gradle Plugin markers for `org.springframework.boot` are not published to the snapshot/milestone repositories
