= Minimal Kotlin Spring Boot Application with Gradle Groovy DSL build

* Very similar to Java and Groovy applications, just has Kotlin compiler configuration added
* Kotlin compiler configuration is now applied to all `KotlinCompile` tasks
* Prefer the `plugins {}` block over `buildscript { dependencies { classpath(..) } }` & `apply plugin:id`
* Plugin repositories moved to `settings.gradle`
